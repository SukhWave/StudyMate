## App Name:

StudyMate: Free Interactive Learning App for Grades 1–8
 
# Introduction:

StudyMate is a free, web-based educational platform designed to help students from Grades 1 through 8 strengthen their core academic skills in Mathematics and English Language Arts. The idea was inspired by my son, a Grade 5 student, who struggles to find free, engaging study tools while most platforms like IXL are locked behind subscriptions. StudyMate aims to remove that barrier by providing a child-friendly, interactive learning environment that's completely free. Using a modern tech stack of PHP, MySQL, and React, the app allows students to practice grade-appropriate exercises, monitor their progress, and stay motivated through gamified rewards. The project will initially launch with content for Grade 3 as a proof of concept, with a fully scalable design ready to expand across all grade levels.
